# ðŸ—¿ Greetings

**Hello! I'm Andri Rahman Hakim, a full stack web developer.** I began my journey in web development with my first project in 2008. I work on both backend and frontend development. My passion is in creating seamless user experiences and visually compelling designs for the web, which resonate with audiences and drive engagement.

As an active web developer, I continuously seek innovative solutions and fresh approaches to problem-solving, driven by my strong desire to learn and grow. 

I am currently accepting new freelance web development clients and actively seeking opportunities to collaborate. With expertise in creating custom web solutions, I welcome projects of any sizeâ€”from simple websites to complex applications. I'm passionate about turning client visions into reality and available to discuss how my skills can support your digital needs.
